# Description
Dynamic Pricing is an application of data science that involves adjusting the prices of a product or service based on various factors in real time. It is used by companies to optimize revenue by setting flexible prices that respond to market demand, demographics, customer behaviour and competitor prices.
Using data-driven insights and algorithms, businesses can dynamically modify prices to achieve the most favourable outcomes.

# Objective
the aim is to maximize revenue and profitability by pricing items at the right level that balances supply and demand dynamics. It allows businesses to adjust prices dynamically based on factors like time of day, day of the week, customer segments, inventory levels, seasonal fluctuations, competitor pricing, and market conditions.
